#### Fifa 19 players

In this program, we look at the players stats in Fifa 19 game and perform some statistical investigations such as:

* Calculating the mean and median values for players' acceleration.
* Drawing a barplot to display the frequency of different preferred foots.
* Calculating z-scores for different values for players' accelerations.
* Drawing a scatterplot to assess the correlation between players' accelerations and their overalls.
* Calculating the cumulative probability for players' weak foot score.
* Creating a sampling distribution for proportions for the players' preferred feet and calculating the mean and the sd for the sampling distribution for proportions.
