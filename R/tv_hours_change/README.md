#### TV hours change

In this program, we look at the data from the GSS and inference if the hours spent on watching TV is changed significantly
from 2000 to 2012 for the US households. We use the Two Means Hypothesis Test for rejecting/not reejcting our hypothesis, and
then, we will compute the Confidence Interval, which returns a result matched to that of the Hypothesis Testing.

Packages used in this program:

- dplyr
- statsr
- ggplot2
