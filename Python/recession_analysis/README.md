#### Energy, GDP, and science

In this program, we look at the countries in energy, GDP, and science rankings to investigate if there are potential correlations.
After cleaning the raw data, we will perform exploratory analysis and answer some questions such as:

* Finding out the average GDP over the last 10 years for each country.
* Finding out how much the GDP has changed over the 10 year span for the country with the 6th largest average GDP.
* Finding out the mean Energy Supply per Capita.
* Finding out the correlation between the number of citable documents per capita and the energy supply per capita; using Pearson's R.

Libraries used in this program:

- pandas
- numpy
