#### Weather patterns

In this program, we draw a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. Then, 
we overlay a scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.

Libraries used in this program:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- datetime
