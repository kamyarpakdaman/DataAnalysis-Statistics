#### Olympics and US census

In this program, we use two datasets about the history of medals countries have gained in olympics, and the census in the US to answer some
questions such as:

* Finding out which country has won the most gold medals in summer games.
* Finding out which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts.
* Finding out what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population).
* Finding out which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015.
